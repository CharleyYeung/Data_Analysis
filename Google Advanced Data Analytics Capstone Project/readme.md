Completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate did not stop me from learning new things. I continued to advance my skills by pursuing the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

Unlike the previous one, this advanced certificate focuses on data science. The course is very comprehensive for students who already have some experiences in data analytics. Google and Coursera organize the course materials so well that I can follow easily. Moreover, it includes numerous engaging, straightforward yet challenging hands-on activities, along with a final capstone project that requires students to start from scratch.  

It took me about two weeks to complete the project, which was unexpected. Although it wasn’t a large-scale project, I put in a great deal of effort and hope you enjoy reading it.

## Scenario

Below is the background of the project provided by the course:  

"The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company."
