My name is Charley Yeung. I am glad that I have had the opportunity to work in the financial sector in Hong Kong for the past 20 years, with experience spanning both front-end and back-end roles.

In 2023, my wife made the exciting decision to follow her dream and study gemmology. In late summer, we relocated from our homeland to the United Kingdom, a country renowned for its world-class education.

After a few months of settling into our new surroundings, I found myself with some spare time. It was then that I began to search for possibilities ahead of me. I thought, why not take this opportunity to learn something new and perhaps start an alternative career in this new chapter of life?

I would not deny that my two decades in finance have been incredibly rewarding. However, I recognise that I ought to move forward, and I am ready to take new challenges.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the pleasure of telling incredible stories about cutting-edge technologies, investment-wise, from big data to blockchain, and artificial intelligence—just to name a few. These technological advancements have featured prominently in my reports, offering clients insights for investment decisions. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong market's appetite for innovation has its limits, and my understanding of these promising technologies has remained at the investment level. Once my reports provided sufficient investment insights for clients, my role was largely complete.

In my search for a new area of interest, data analysis and science drew my attention. These disciplines are rooted in statistics — something I enjoyed studying during my university days. The only thing left for me to master was coding.

Starting in March 2024, I began teaching myself to code using various online resources and physical books. I’ve been working hard building a solid foundation in statistical coding and have also learned to use tools such as Tableau and GitHub. These new skills have brought me immense satisfaction, just like what I had experienced 20 years ago, when I first entered the financial sector. After four months of disciplined self-study, I decided it was time to embark on my own data analysis projects.

As of October 2024, I have completed two analysis-focused projects and one mini project: the Football Project, the Economics Project, and an online fax automation project. The first project demonstrates my understanding of how coding can be applied to conduct statistical analyses on the expenditures and actual performance of English Premier League football clubs during the transfer windows. The second project has enabled me to further explore time series analysis, comparing the performance of various financial markets with yield spread movements and making predictions using machine learning techniques.

The mini project, which I worked on between the two larger projects, was a practical exercise to help me learn different applications of Python and its related tools. It involved creating a system for my former football team to book pitches online. While I have uploaded the first two projects to GitHub, I am unable to share the third due to privacy concerns.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I invite you to explore my projects further!
