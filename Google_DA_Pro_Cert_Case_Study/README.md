After the 2 projects I had completed, I started to find concrete data analysis resources to learn from. The first couple courses were held by LinkedIn. Within a week after I finished them, I started another well known certificate course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which is [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).   
  
It had been around 30 days until I completed it. I enjoyed every second of studying the course materials. But time I spent most was on the case study. I had to use R, a new language for me, to analyze the data and present it with an rmd file.  
  
Although I had already had some experience in data analysis, a new language was still a challenge, and I loved to take it!
