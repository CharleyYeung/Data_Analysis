## Forewords

After the 2 projects I had completed, I started to find concrete data analysis resources to learn from. The first couple of courses were held by LinkedIn. Within a week after I finished them, I started another well-known certificate course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which is [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).  

It had been around 30 days until I completed it. I enjoyed every second of studying the course materials. But the time I spent most was on the case study. I had to use R, a new language for me, to analyze the data and present it with an Rmd file.  

Although I had already had some experience in data analysis, a new language was still a challenge, and I loved to take it! Below I am presenting you my work done with the help of the course.  

## Scenario

Below is the background of the project provided by the course:  

"You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global small device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing small device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze small device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their small devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy."
