This was my very first data analysis project, which I began in June 2024 and completed over two months.

The motivation behind this project was simple: I firmly believe that practice makes perfect. While reading resources is valuable, nothing teaches better than hands-on experience.

I chose football as the subject for my first project because of my love for the game. As a fan of the English Premier League (EPL), I’ve often wondered: with the rapidly rising player transfer fees, are clubs really getting value for their money? Initially, I wasn’t sure how to begin. However, I discovered that the renowned website [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/) contains a wealth of data that could help answer this question.

Gathering the necessary has caused me some trouble. Yet undergoing quite some searching and reading, I managed to compile raw data on EPL transfer transactions from 1993 to 2024. I then realised I would need additional data to benchmark team performance, so I turned to the [English Premier League Official Website](https://www.premierleague.com/) for further information.

With the raw data saved in the folder [/data/raw/](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Football_Project/data) , I encountered issues such as inconsistent club names, number formats, and data types across the files. To address this, I created  [/Renaming_process.py](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/Renaming_preprocess.py) to standardise the values, saving the results as _.temp files in the [/data/preprocessed/](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Football_Project/data/preprocessed) folder . 

The next step was to perform calculations and join tables, which I accomplished with [/data_proprocess.py](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/data_preprocess.py). The cleaned output files are stored in [/data/cleaned/](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Football_Project/data/cleaned), completing the preprocessing phase.

Finally, [/main.py](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/main.py) produced the analysis results, consisting of various comparison graphs and statistical outputs, all saved in the [/data/analysis/](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Football_Project/data/analysis).

Here are some insights:

![Distribution of Goal differences for Each Club](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/data/analysis/goal_diff_boxplot.png) visualises the goal differences (GD) for notable Premier League clubs. As expected, Manchester City leads the pack, followed by Chelsea and Arsenal. Interestingly, these clubs also display the widest range of goal differences among the top five, which could lend some weight to the old adage, "high risk, high reward. At the other end of the spectrum, Sheffield United has the lowest GD, with a best of net 0 and a significant negative tail.

![Distribution of Net Expense for Top 20 Clubs by Average Points](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/data/analysis/top_20_club_net_expense_boxplot.png) shows the net expense distribution across the data period. Notably, Chelsea, who has yet escaped from facing the 115 charge related to financial regulations, avoids topping the league in net expenditure, with their extreme spending years marked as outliers. Manchester City claims the top spot, with Manchester United close behind. This might disappoint some United fans who feel the club hasn’t spent enough. In contrast, Liverpool, despite spending less, has effectively balanced transfers, often selling players at a profit. As expected, Brighton & Hove Albion and West Ham consistently emerge as "selling clubs," regularly profiting from player sales.

The file [club_analysis_results.txt](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/data/analysis/club_analysis_results.txt) contains averages of yearly spending, points differences, goals scored, and goals conceded for each club. More insightful figures are provided by the overall cost per point, cost per goal scored, and cost per goal conceded. Positive numbers indicate a direct relationship between spending and improvements in point differences or goals scored, while negative numbers reflect the cost per goal successfully defended. For example, Birmingham FC has spent £4.24 million for each additional league point, £26.52 million for each additional goal scored, and £11.78 million to successfully defend an additional goal. While these figures are influenced by how long a club remains in the Premier League, they still offer interesting insights. For instance, although Manchester United has allocated significant funds to bolstering both their attack and defence, Manchester City has focused more on defensive upgrades. Their spending has been offset by strategic transfers, selling attackers at high prices and buying replacements at lower costs. Yearly average cost figures are available for each club, allowing for comparisons on a year-by-year basis.

The chart ![scenario_analysis_corr.png](https://github.com/CharleyYeung/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Football_Project/data/analysis/scenario_analysis_corr.png) illustrates how the top Premier League teams perform after acquiring additional attackers, midfielders, and defenders, specifically in terms of goals scored, successful passes, and goals conceded. Interestingly, for many of the leading Premier League teams, there isn’t a convincing correlation between signing additional players and improved performance in these areas.

In conclusion, despite the ever-increasing transfer fees, it appears that Premier League teams are underperforming relative to the money spent during the transfer windows.

Afterword:-
Self-teaching is challenging, but certainly not impossible. There were times when I felt frustrated and unsure about how to proceed with the project. Thankfully, I received immense mental support from my wife and valuable technical assistance from a teammate on my football team, which helped me navigate through those difficult moments.
